# PPWCode.Vernacular.Contracts

This library is part of the [ppwcode] project and encapsulates the vernacular on contracts.

## Getting started

### PPWCode.Vernacular.Contracts I

This is version `I` of the library, which is designed to work with .NET 6.0.

The library is available as the [NuGet] package `PPWCode.Vernacular.Contracts.I` in the [NuGet Gallery].

## [ppwcode]

This package is part of the [ppwcode] project by [PeopleWare n.v.].

More information can be found in the following locations:

* [ppwcode] website
* [BitBucket]
* [GitHub]

### PPWCode .NET

For the .NET libraries, development will be done in the [BitBucket] (and [GitHub]) repositories, and all new stable
releases will also be published as packages on the [NuGet Gallery].

We believe in Design By Contract. In the way that this is possible, pre-conditions, post-conditions and invariants are
enforced in the code using extra `assert`-like statements. Things that cannot be reasonable enforced this way, are
tested in unit tests.

Published packages include both the `pdb` and `xml` files, for debugging symbols and documentation respectively. In the
future we might look into using symbol servers.
